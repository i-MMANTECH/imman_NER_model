This repository demonstrates how to implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Python, leveraging Jupyter Notebooks within Visual Studio Code (VSCode). It includes step-by-step guides, code snippets, and explanations to help you understand and apply NER techniques effectively.


Here's a step-by-step description for your GitHub repository on named entity recognition (NER) in Python using Jupyter Notebook on Visual Studio Code (VSCode):

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
- **Install Python and VSCode**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) set up as your IDE.
- **Install Jupyter Extension**: Add the Jupyter extension in VSCode to enable notebook functionality within the editor.
- **Set Up Virtual Environment**: Create and activate a virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies.

### Step 2: Install Necessary Libraries
- **Install Required Packages**: Use pip to install necessary Python libraries such as `spaCy`, `nltk`, and `pandas` for data processing, and `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualization.
  ```bash
  pip install spacy nltk pandas matplotlib
  ```
- **Download NER Model**: Download a pre-trained NER model using spaCy.
  ```bash
  python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
  ```

### Step 3: Load and Explore Data
- **Load Text Data**: Use Python to load the dataset containing the text you want to analyze. This could be a CSV, JSON, or any other format.
- **Explore the Data**: Perform initial exploration to understand the structure and content of your text data using pandas.

### Step 4: Preprocess the Text Data
- **Text Cleaning**: Clean the text data by removing unnecessary characters, lowercasing, and handling punctuation using regular expressions and NLP techniques.
- **Tokenization**: Tokenize the text into sentences or words using spaCy or nltk.
  
### Step 5: Apply Named Entity Recognition
- **Load Pre-Trained NER Model**: Load the spaCy pre-trained NER model and apply it to your text data to identify named entities such as persons, organizations, dates, etc.
- **Extract Entities**: Extract and display named entities from the text using spaCy’s NER pipeline.
  
### Step 6: Visualize the Results
- **Visualize Named Entities**: Use visualization tools like spaCy’s `displacy` or Matplotlib to graphically represent the named entities identified in the text.
- **Analyze Entity Distribution**: Plot and analyze the distribution of different named entities across your dataset.
